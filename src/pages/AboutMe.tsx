                        Hello! I'm Devesh, a final year Software Engineering student at the University of Auckland.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm passionate about computer networking, full-stack development, and DevOps. I enjoy working with microprocessors and creating tech projects that help people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of tech, I love watching sports, tinkering with gadgets, designing, and playing ping pong. I'm a creative, hardworking, and curious person, always eager to learn and take on new challenges.  Traveling is something I'm excited to add to my hobbies soon!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're in Auckland and would like to connect, let's grab a coffee! ü§ùüèΩ
